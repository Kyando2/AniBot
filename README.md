## General information

```diff
-  This is a revamp of an old project Takagi-Bot 2019 fused with 金 Butler and Student Council president three of my first bots, feel free to edit and take inspiration from it.
```

## Development
```diff
+ Most of the code was written by me, most of it actually comes from Takagi-Bot 2019 and 金 Butler but a lot of it has been re-written and revamped. 
+ Some of the code was also taken from other open sources project such as Kyando2/Captain_Webhook and Rapptz/discord.py/examples. I'm using MySQL for most of the data.
