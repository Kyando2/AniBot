## General information
#### This is a revamp of an old project Takagi-Bot 2020 fused with 金 Butler, feel free to edit and take inspiration from it.
## Development
All the code was written by me, most of it actually comes from Takagi-Bot 2020 and 金 Butler but a lot of it has been re-written and revamped
## License
This is an open source project under GNU Affero General Public License v3.0.
## Future info
The bot currently uses Json to save information but I'm planning on using a database.
